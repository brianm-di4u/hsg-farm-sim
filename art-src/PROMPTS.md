# Image-generation prompts

Every painted image in `assets/` was made with the image generation tool of the OpenAI Codex CLI (session model GPT-6.1 Sol) from one of the
prompts below, then packed by `tools/pack-art.mjs` with the settings in `art.json` (white keyed out, trimmed,
resized, textures made seamless). The prompts are copied verbatim. They were written when the game lived in a
monorepo, so most paths start `games/farm-sim/`; that folder is now the root of this repository.

Style references: the first batch (the pilot) had none. Every later batch names earlier generated images from
`art-src/` (the approved pilot, or an earlier output) as its style reference. No photographs or third-party images
were given to the generator, as references or as image-to-image inputs.

The characters are not generated images: they are Blender renders from `art-src/blender/characters.py`.
Generated source PNGs are kept out of git (`art-src/**/*.png`); the packed WebP files in `assets/` are the shipped
output.

## 1. Pilot: painted style set (2026-10-29)

```text
Working directory: C:\Video Game Projects. Image-generation task (use your image generation tool; copy each final image to the exact repo path given). Do not edit any other files.

We are making original hand-painted art for a top-down farming/life sim set in the Hot Springs, Arkansas valley. This is a STYLE PILOT: 4 images that will become the style reference for ~100 later images, so make them excellent and mutually consistent.

STYLE (all images): hand-painted gouache storybook game art; clean, readable shapes; soft sunlight from the upper left; gentle cel-like shading with visible painterly brush texture; thin warm dark-brown outlines (not black); rich but natural colours; crisp edges, no blur, no vignette, no text, no lettering, no logos, no signatures.
CAMERA for objects: high-angle three-quarter top-down view (camera tilted about 55 degrees down, orthographic, no perspective convergence): you see the roof/top from above AND the front (south-facing) side below it, like a classic top-down farming game. The object is centred, fills the frame width, its base touches the bottom of the frame. Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF), no ground, no cast shadow on the ground (shadows are added in code).

1. `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-plankbath.png` — square 1024x1024. A small 1870s frontier wooden bathhouse (rough-sawn vertical plank walls, weathered grey-brown wood, wood-shingle gable roof with ridge running left–right, a plain board door centred on the front, two small square windows, a stovepipe with a thin wisp of steam, a tiny plank porch step). Its footprint is square: it should fill the image width.
2. `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-oak.png` — portrait 768x1024. A broad southern red oak in summer: rounded clumpy canopy made of a few big painted leaf clusters, short thick trunk visible below the canopy, roots flaring at the base. Base of trunk at bottom-centre.
3. `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-grass.png` — square 1024x1024, a frameless TEXTURE seen straight from above (not three-quarter): short meadow grass, painterly clumps and strokes in a few mid-greens with small lighter and darker variation, very even overall tone and evenly lit (no light gradient, no vignette, no large features, no flowers, no objects) so it can tile seamlessly.
4. `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-cabin.png` — landscape 1536x1024. An 1807 frontier log farm cabin (single-pen saddle-notched round-log cabin, clay chinking, split-shake roof with ridge running left–right, fieldstone stick-and-mud chimney at the left gable end, a plank door, one small shuttered window, a short front porch). Footprint 6 wide by 4 deep. Fills the width.

Report the four paths when done.

Working directory: C:\Video Game Projects. Image-generation task: generate each image with your image generation tool and copy the final file to the exact repo path given. Do not edit any other files.

Original hand-painted art for a top-down farming sim set in the Hot Springs, Arkansas valley. STYLE REFERENCES (open and match them closely: camera angle, painting style, light, level of detail, outline colour): `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-plankbath.png` and `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-cabin.png`. Slightly simplify fine texture compared to the references so shapes read well when shown small (~200 px wide), but keep the same painterly look.

COMMON RULES for every image: hand-painted gouache storybook game art; soft sunlight from the upper left; thin warm dark-brown outlines; high-angle three-quarter top-down view (camera tilted ~55° down, orthographic, no perspective convergence): roof seen from above and the south-facing front below it; roof ridge runs left–right unless stated; the building is centred and fills the image width, its front base touches the bottom of the image; pure flat white background (#FFFFFF); NO ground, NO grass base, NO cast shadow, NO people, NO text, NO lettering, NO signs with words, NO logos. Where a sign board is mentioned it must be BLANK (plain painted board; the game writes the words). Historically plausible for the Arkansas Ouachita frontier.

Square images are 1024x1024 (building footprint 5 wide × 5 deep). Landscape images are 1536x1024 (footprint 6 wide × 4 deep, or as stated).

STYLE REFERENCES (open and match closely: camera angle, painting style, light, outline colour, level of detail): `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-plankbath.png`, `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-farm-ranch.png` and `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-farm-restored.png`. Slightly simplify fine texture so shapes read well when shown ~220 px wide.

COMMON RULES: hand-painted gouache storybook game art; soft sunlight from the upper left; thin warm dark-brown outlines; high-angle three-quarter top-down view (camera ~55° down, orthographic, no perspective convergence): roof seen from above and the south-facing front below it; the building is centred, fills the image width, and its front base touches the bottom edge; pure flat white background (#FFFFFF); NO ground, NO grass, NO parking lot, NO cast shadow, NO people, NO cars, NO text, NO lettering, NO logos; any sign must be BLANK. Generic fictional buildings in period style.

Square = 1024x1024 (footprint 5 wide × 5 deep). Wide = 1536x1024 (footprint 10 wide × 5 deep; fills the full width, wider than tall).

Working directory: C:\Video Game Projects. Image-generation task: generate each image with your image generation tool (use image EDITING from the named source where stated) and copy the final file to the exact repo path given. Do not edit any other files.

PART A — four 2026 versions of existing building paintings, by EDITING the 1931 originals so each keeps the SAME building, camera, outline style and white background, now restored a century later for new uses (no text, no lettering, no logos; signs BLANK; no people, no cars, no ground, no cast shadow; output 1024x1024):
1. `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-row-1r.png` from `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-row-1.png`: restored and reused as a brewery: fresh cream stucco, new red tile, the loggia now a patio with a few café tables and big copper brewing kettles visible through tall glass doors, string lights, planters.
2. `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-row-2r.png` from `bld-row-2.png`: restored as a spa: the tiled dome gleaming and repaired, crisp paint, potted palms by the arched entry, a blank wooden menu board.
3. `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-row-3r.png` from `bld-row-3.png`: restored as a cultural centre: cleaned brick, white columns, a pair of blank vertical banners hung between columns, benches.
4. `games/farm-sim/art-src/bld-row-4r.png` from `bld-row-4.png`: restored as a boutique hotel: new copper marquee with warm lights, flower boxes in the windows, a doorman's lamp, a small luggage cart.

PART B — six era panoramas (landscape 1536x1024 each) for the title screen and chapter transitions of a historical farming game set in the Hot Springs valley, Arkansas. Same painting style family as `games/farm-sim/art-src/pilot-plankbath.png` but as wide scenic landscape illustrations: hand-painted gouache storybook look, rich light, depth with atmospheric perspective. SAME COMPOSITION in all six so they cross-fade well: the viewer stands on a gentle rise in the creek-bottom farmland; in the left foreground a family farmhouse and a small field of crops beside a split creek; a small creek winds from the foreground into the middle distance; in the centre middle distance a narrow valley town (the spa town) nestled at the foot of a forested mountain on the right whose lower slope steams with hot springs (white wisps rising from the hillside); long, low, rounded forested Ouachita Mountain ridges run left to right in layered blue-green bands behind; a big sky. Keep the most important things inside the central 60% of the width (it will be cropped on phones). NO text, NO logos, NO borders, NO people in the foreground (tiny distant figures are fine).
5. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-1.png` — 1807, early spring morning: untouched oak-and-shortleaf-pine forest, no town at all; only a few brush huts and a canvas trader's tent by the steaming springs, campfire smoke; the farm is a tiny round-log cabin with a stick chimney and a small new clearing with stumps.
6. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-2.png` — 1871, overcast late afternoon: a raw frontier boomtown squeezed into the narrow valley: two lines of plank bathhouses and false-front stores along a muddy street beside the open creek, wooden footbridges, stumps on the hills, a stagecoach; the farm is a board-and-batten house with a split-rail fence and a cow.
7. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-3.png` — 1886, golden summer evening: a booming Victorian resort: ornate wooden bathhouses with little towers and verandas in a row, red-brick business blocks, a large many-towered resort hotel on the hillside, a small railway with a steam train and depot, gas lamps; the farm is a red-brick two-storey farmhouse with orchards.
8. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-4.png` — 1931, bright clear day, colours like a 1930s linen postcard (saturated, slightly chalky): a row of cream-stucco and red-tile Mediterranean revival bathhouses, one with a tiled dome; a big twin-towered Spanish-style hotel; 1930s cars; and in the right middle distance a brand-new lake (just dammed) with raw red-clay shores and drowned tree stumps; the farm is a craftsman bungalow with a Model-A truck.
9. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-5.png` — 1955, warm sunset, Kodachrome colours: motor hotels with tall neon pylon signs (unlit or just lighting up, no readable words), a drive-in, tail-finned cars, the bathhouse row still there; the lake now mature with docks, fishing boats and a few lake cabins; the farm is a ranch house with a big red barn and a tractor.
10. `games/farm-sim/art-src/vista-6.png` — 2026, cool blue dusk with warm windows: the restored bathhouse row glowing with warm light and string lights, modern LED street lights, a farmers' market pavilion, lake homes and docks along the lake, a few solar panels on roofs; the farm is a restored white farmhouse with solar panels, raised beds and a greenhouse.
