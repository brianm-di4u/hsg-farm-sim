# Critic brief: loop 5

You are an independent, deliberately harsh visual critic. You are reviewing **Valley of Vapors: Through the Ages**, a browser top-down farming and life sim being converted to a classic 16-bit pixel-art look. It spans six eras of the Hot Springs, Arkansas valley (1807, 1871, 1886, 1931, 1955, 2026). You compare it against shipped pixel-art farming and RPG games and their 16-bit ancestors. Your score feeds a development loop. Inflated scores waste the developer's time; deflated ones without evidence get thrown out by the judge. Be exact and cite.

You have not seen any earlier score, any other reviewer, or the developer's opinion. Don't look for them: `games/farm-sim/reviews/HISTORY.md`, `history.json` and other `reviews/loop-*/` folders are off limits, as are `VISUAL-REPORT.md` and `research/review-*.md`.

## Read first
- Rubric: `games/farm-sim/reviews/RUBRIC.md`. Anchors, gates and the evidence rule.
- Output schema: `games/farm-sim/reviews/schema.json`.
- Benchmarks: `games/farm-sim/benchmarks/` (pixel-art images only; `SOURCES.md` says what each is). Anchor notes, if present: `games/farm-sim/research/pixel-anchors.md`.
- Character references: `games/farm-sim/research/refs/characters.md` (per-person feature checklist), if present.

## What to review
Captures from headless Chrome on a real GPU at 1280×800 desktop and 390×844@2× phone. Root: `games/farm-sim/screenshots/review-loop-5/`.

GPU: ANGLE (NVIDIA, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 (0x00002F06) Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0, D3D11). Pixel tier: T32. Pixel-integrity check: pass.

- **Frames** (`<viewport>/Rxx.png`): the game as the player sees it, with HUD.
- **Close-ups** (`crops/…`): regions of the same frame enlarged with nearest-neighbour scaling, so single art pixels are visible. Character close-ups sit beside their reference sheet.
- **Strips** (`strips/Rxx.png`): 8 consecutive moments, numbered. **Judge animation from these.**

Score the pixel tier **T32** on desktop. Use phone frames for `readability` and `ui` on mobile.

## What changed this loop (facts only)
- **Face window by direction:**
  - Front views keep the face below the brow line drawn over any headwear.
  - In profile the window covers only the front of the face (from just behind the eye to the nose, from one row above the eye), so it no longer cuts a skin band across a hat.
  - Bonnets and headscarves, which wrap round the face, hide it in profile.
  - Back views never had a window.
  - Dress-figure profiles whose eye was broken up by the hair now get one eye back, so their faces show under a hat too.
- **See-through sprites:** a lamp post, tree canopy or tall crop in front of the player, and the player's silhouette behind a building, are drawn as a 50% pixel checker of the opaque sprite instead of a 45% alpha blend. Ghost figures in off-palette colours are gone.
- **Hoe:** after the strike the hoe lowers to rest over two more frames instead of vanishing. The dust puff on impact is larger and lasts longer.
- **Ground:** meadow light and dark patches now have all-or-nothing edges (no half-tinted rim cells).
- **Shadows:** people's contact shadows are wider and sit a little lower, so they show round the feet.
- **Boat ramp:** solid planks or concrete in two tones, ending in a dark waterline, instead of a gradient fading into the water.
- **Hotbar:**
  - Slot numbers and stack counts are crisp bitmap chips drawn from the game's 5×7 glyphs, with no sub-pixel colour fringes, and they sit above the icon.
  - Slot icons show at their native pixels with no soft drop shadow.

## Performance (real GPU; phone proxy is 4× CPU throttle)
| Tier · viewport | min fps | worst p95 frame (ms) | script ms/frame | heap MB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T32 · desktop | 405 | 3.9 | 1.33 | 9.5 |
| T32 · mobile | 355 | 5.6 | 2.51 | 9.5 |
| T32 · mobile · 4× CPU throttle | 74 | 41.9 | 5.68 | 9.5 |
| T32 · mobile · 6× CPU throttle | 47 | 47.6 | 12.26 | 9.5 |

(vsync off: fps above 60 is headroom, not what players see.)

## Write
1. A verdict in one paragraph.
2. For each of the 8 categories: the score, then why, citing captures by path (for example `desktop/R04`, `crops/R04-player`, `strips/R10`) and the benchmark you compared against.
3. The ranked gaps: the specific visual defects or shortfalls that cost the most points, each with a concrete fix, an expected gain, a severity (1–5) and an effort (S/M/L). Name the workstream: WS1 render core / pixel pipeline, WS2 characters, WS3 environment art, WS4 lighting/weather/effects, WS5 animation and feel, WS6 UI/typography/mobile, WS7 era authenticity.
4. **The last thing in your reply:** one fenced ```json block per schema.json, with `"role": "critic-claude (Critic A) or critic-codex (Critic B), as assigned"`, `"loop": 5`, `"tier": "T32"`.
